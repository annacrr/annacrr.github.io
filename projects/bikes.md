<h1>Introduction</h1><br>


In this project, we will analyze bicycle's rental demand to uncover which factors impact the customers' preference for using our service. We will compare temporal features, weather conditions, holidays indicators, and other relevant variables using diversified data visualizations and descriptive analytics. By employing boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps weaim to reveal key relationships and impact of those factors. These insights will lead us through the development of actionable recommendations to optimize operations and maximize rental results. When these key patterns are identified, it is possible to translate the extensive, complex figures into data-driven strategies that will enhance customer satisfaction.<br>

<h1> Key Insights</h1>

After analyzing the provided data, three key insights were uncovered:

<b>1.</b> Users comfort  strongly impacts the motivation to rent and ride a bike, and temperature is a direct driver of comfort (Kane & Kythreotis, 2023). Even during winter season, days that see comfortable Dew Point temperature have a significant jump in bike rentals, confirming that warmer days spark demand. Secondary weather factors like humidity, visibility, and Dew Point temperature boost these effects even more, providing stronger evidence that comfort affects motivation to ridership. Customers are more likely to utilize bikes during warmer days, with more humidity and better visibility, with Dew Point temperature around 5 to 20 degrees; in practice, this indicates that warmer, sunny days with comfortable humidity represent opportunity windows. <br><br>
<b>2.</b> 8 am and 6 pm register the highest rental volume, highlighting the importance of rental bikes as primary means of commute transportation. The peaks, that align with rush hour window time, reveal that convenience rentals are the main motivation for rentals, rather than leisure. Although commute stands out as the main trip purpose (Zhang et al., 2024), one of the hourly peaks, 9 pm, indicates interest for leisure usage, but in smaller demand. However, rush hour spikes account for majority of daily rentals, illustrating the predictability of demand cycle. With this data, the company is able to prepare for peak hours.<br><br>
<b>3.</b> Demand is extremely sensitive to seasons. In contrast to the first insight, winter season faces the lowest rental counts, while other seasons are affected during colder days (Dill & Gliebe, 2008). Summer, for its warmth and humidity, has the highest rental counts and most popular months. For this reason, off-season promotions and marketing campaigns focused on commute benefits can avoid low rentals during winter and ensure more bicycles availability during higher demand periods.<br>

These findings can be confirmed by <span style="background-color: #dfc6f6">prior studies</span> that support the facts that:
* Bicycle users are sensitive to weather, and temperature is the strongest driver;
* Bikes are commonly used during peak hours, especially to go to work, which is the second most frequent trip purpose after going back home.<br><br><br>

<h1>The answers you're looking for</h1>

************

<span style= "font-size: 17px;"><b>1.</b> In your analytical opinion, why are the majority of users renting bicycles?</span><br>

>As previously stated, users are utilizing bicycles mainly for commuting purposes. This can be identified by the Hour of Day vs. Rentals visual and analysis, where peak usage times is during  morning and evening commute windows, with a stable growth from 6 am to 8 am, and second growth from 4 pm to 6 pm, where it reaches the highest peak. There is another peak at 9 pm, which indicates leisure usage. The present reliance on bikes for work-home trips urge for a marketing emphasis on reliability and speed over recreation. This understanding empowers the company to develop data-driven strategies to capture high loyalty customers that see the vehicle as a convenient form of commuting.

<span style= "font-size: 17px;"><b>2.</b> Are there ideal weather conditions that create high bike rental demand? If so, what are they?</span>

>Yes, there are ideal conditions for a high demand. First and most importantly, weather comfort is one of the main drivers of demand. Users have a strong preference for warmer and moderate humidity days, with temperature around 15 to 25 degrees, and 40% to 60% humidity, as conditions are not severe. They also prefer better visibility, over 1200, avoiding rainfalls and snowfalls for more comfort and satefy; this, combined with Dew Point temperature from 5 to 20 degrees, provide a pleasant amount of wind and moisture, which translates into more rentals.

<span style= "font-size: 17px;"><b>3.</b> How should the company strategize based on your results? In other words, what actionable steps can the company take in order to take advantage of your insights.</span>

Based on the findings above, there are a few adjustments that can be made to enhance rental demand and customer satisfaction:

>The companies in the rental business understand the importance of maintenance. The time for these adjustments should be schedule to fit low movement hours after 9 pm.<br><br>
During commute hours there is a higher demand for bike rentals, and by allocating a higher number of bikes for availability in high traffic areas can increase number of usage and, consequently, increase profit. Reallocation is also useful during summer time, while winter season can benefit from lower bicycle availability, allowing rotation during low season for better maintenance and lower erosion.<br><br>
The company's app can also benefit from notification alerts for clearer, warmer weathers (<s>in a Starbucks style</s>) to encourage customers to utilize the vehicle, which can be beneficial especially during winter.<br><br>
Users respond positively to promotions. Usage can be encourage during low hours with better pricing close to peak times. With  this strategy, it is possible to avoid congestion and lack of availability during rush hour, while also encouraging one-time users to include rental bikes in their commute routine. This type of promotions also work during low season, like Winter, or during excessive heat days during the summer.

<h3>First results</h3><br>

After loading the file and obtaining a first output to visualize the records, the next step was to evaluate the information related to each variable and identify if there were any columns or items that required transformation. Considering that "Hour" does not have any numerical/statistical value for the current analysis, since it is purely a time label instead of a continuous measure, I used the <span style="background-color: #dfc6f6"><i> usecols = range(4, 15)</i></span> to exclude from the descriptive summary results.

At first glance, it is possible to observe that the <b>Rentals</b> standard deviation is 694.72, almost as high as the mean of 810.02. Such high dispersion indicates possible outliers; we can observe, for example, a maximum bike rentals of 3.734 in a single day. To understand the reason, it needs further investigation, but we can consider the likeliness of being driven due to seasonality, holidays, or weather.

Another distinct detail is that <b>Visibility</b> also has significant variations with possible outliers. The lowest visibility registered in the data is 81 m, and when comparing to the maximum (2000) and average (1434) we can observe that this number is very low number and rare, which may coincide with drops in demand.

To better understand how these and other factors truly affect bike rentals, we  will proceed with deeper statistical analysis and relevant visualization. This way, we can reveal the relationship between the variables and rental demand.

<h3>Explanation</h3><br>

Now that the strings are transformed into relevant numerical codes, we can ensure that each variable can be compared and correlated to the <b>rentals</b>, and understand its impact and relevance. The numbers and features were organized in the following format:<br>

<span style="background-color: #dfc6f6">Seasons:<br></span>
Winter = 1<br>
Spring = 2<br>
Summer = 3<br>
Autumn = 4<br>

<span style="background-color: #dfc6f6">Month:<br></span>
From 1 to 12, following its respective order:<br>
Jan = 1<br>
Feb = 2<br>
[...]<br>
Dec = 12<br>

<span style="background-color: #dfc6f6">Week of day:<br></span>
From 1 to 7, starting on Monday:<br>
Monday = 1<br>
Tuesday = 2<br>
[...]<br>
Sunday = 7<br>

<span style="background-color: #dfc6f6">Holidays:<br></span>
No: 0<br>
Yes: 1<br>

<h2> Analysis </h2><br>

With the transformations done, we can now start our correlation analysis and produce clear, interpretable visualization to assess their influence in rental demand.

<h3>Pearson Correlation Results</h3>

The Person Correlation Coefficient measures the strength of a relationship between variables with ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no correlation.

From this first output, we can gather some key points:
<h4><span style="background-color: #dfc6f6">Strong Relationship:</h4></span><br>
1. <b>Temperature</b>: The strongest relationship in the table is between Rentals & Temperature, indicating that warmer days have more rentals.<br>
2. <b>Season</b>: Although there is a strong connection between higher Rentals & Season, we need further investigation to understand which seasons influence the demand positively and negatively.<br>
3. <b> Hour of Day</b>: It is possible to see that Hour of Day & Rentals are closely related, meaning that some times of the day will have more rentals, while others will have less.

<h4><span style="background-color: #dfc6f6">Moderate Relationship:</h4></span><br>
While not as strong influences, these moderate impact variables should still be considered when developing strategies to maximize rental demand.<br><br>
1. <b>Dew Point Temperature</b>: More comfortable (warmer + moderate humidity) days result in higher rentals.<br>
2. <b>UV Index</b>, <b>Visibility</b>, and <b>Humidity</b>: all these 3 factors have an impact in demand, meaning that sunnier, clearer and less muggy days results in more rentals.

***************


```python
# boxplot comparing season and rentals
sns.boxplot (x = 'Season',
            y = 'Rentals',
            data = bikes_data,)

# customization of the boxplot
plt.title(label = """
Bike Rentals Variation by Season
""")

# displaying the visual
plt.show(block = True)
```

<h3>Season vs. Rentals Boxplot</h3>

When comparing the distribution of rentals with season, we can see that <b>Winter</b> is in the bottom range, with a median of less than 500 rentals, around 200 to 300, with the interquartile range being narrow, indicating that demand is consistently low during Winter, with some extreme rentals days.

<b>Spring</b> shows a drastic difference from the previous season, the median climbs to over 500 and has a greater variability, with some outliers hitting over 3000 rentals per day. This points out that users feel more comfortable using rental bikes during warmer periods.

The highest median and peaks happen during the <b>Summer</b>. With a median of around 1000 rentals and outliers that reach 3500+ rentals, this season shows consistent higher demand, with even its low days reaching above 500 rentals per day.

Finally, <b>Autumn</b> follows Summer's rental trends, with a median that is slightly above 1000 rentals and a high variability. This tells us that Autumn has a consistent high demand, but is more stable than Summer, with less rental peaks.

<h3>Winter Peak Days Analysis</h3><br>

Following the Rentals vs. Season boxplot, we can proceed to investigate the cause of the outliers on low demand seasons. When we isolate Winter season and high rentals, a pattern emerges:
* Most of the rentals in peak day happen during the morning and evening commute window, 8am and 6pm.
* Renting bikes is also a viable option when days are clearer (visibility generally above 1000), and with dryer days (no rain or snowfall)

Finally, although winter registers generally lower demand, these outliers demonstrate that users sees bike rentals as a convenient way of commuting during brighter and dryer days. The company should consider these for a dynamic fleet allocation and target more availability during weekdays and promotions for peak commute hours users.

<h3>Month & Temperature vs.  Rentals (Part I)</h3><br>

As stated before, warmer temperature drives the outliers further to the right, meaning more rentals, and the scatter plot above reinforces this.

June and July, the peak summer months, consistently register the highest rental counts. In contrast, peak rental days in winter, autumn, and spring occur during periods when the temperature reaches above 10 degrees and around 20 degrees.

Colder days generally result in fewer rentals, which is highlighted by colder temperature markers being grouped mostly in the first segment of the plot. Here we can find December, January, and February (winter months), with no outliers moving after the first vertical demarcation.

Following the summer season, autumn experiences many days with comfortable temperatures, translating into higher rental volume when compared to other transitional seasons.

Although warmer days generally see more frequent rentals, the plot reveals that excessive heat often harms demand, since it impacts users' comfort and, consequently, their preference for utilizing the service. Days where the temperature hits above 30 degrees cluster in the first and second division lines (mid-demand), while Summer days that see peak rentals are usually around or below 30 degrees, but above 20 degrees.

<h3>Month & Temperature vs.  Rentals (Part II)</h3><br>

Even though the previous scatter plot had a major role in informing how temperature affects rentals and, consequently, affects the months of most usage to less usage, the graph above is a cleaner visualization of bike rentals per month, reinforcing the periods of peak demand, them being June, the first and highest peak, with a stable demand until October, the second peak, during autumn season.

Additionally, it facilitates the view of the months where rental steeply decreases. This drastic drop remains constant for during November and December, and increases slowly throughout January and February. With adequate strategies, the abrupt drop can be softened with off-season promotions and targeted marketing during clearer days.

<h3>Hour vs. Rentals</h3><br>

The continuous time plot showcases the rental variation during hourly periods, and because there is a lot of details to uncover, we'll explore through sections:

* <b>Low movement </b><br>
The overnight time faces a consistent drop on rentals starting from the evening peak at 9 pm, and only starts rising up again around 6 am.<br><br>

* <b>First peak</b><br>
As movement starts to ramp up at 6 am, rentals see a steep growth until it reaches its first peak at 8 am, a common commute time morning window, indicating users' preference for rental bikes as a form of transportation to work.<br><br>

* <b>Mid-level traffic</b><br>
After the 8 am peak, a constant mid-traffic level starts, maintaining a median of around 700 to 1200 during late-morning and afternoon hours.<br><br>

* <b>Rush hour</b><br>
At 5 pm the rentals steeply grow, reaching the highest peak that occurs around 6 pm, another specific evening time commute window, reaching a median of almost 1750 rentals. This data reinforces what was previously concluded, that users see rental bikes as a convenient commute vehicle.<br><br>

* <b>Last peak</b><br>
The last peak happens at 9 pm, indicating that users still utilize the services for personal leisure time, after that, the usage continuously drop until morning hours.<br><br>

* <b>Invisible details</b><br>
The bars outside the squares indicate the variability inside each times, meaning that during overnight time there is last variability, it is constantly low volume of rentals, while during peak hours the variation is higher.

<h3> Dew Point Temperature vs. Rentals</h3><br>

Dew Point Temperature indicates how warm and humid the air is, leading to more or less comfort, depending on the temperature. The point of -30 indicates colder, drier days, while the other edge, 30, indicates more moisture and more warmth. Translating this extreme to an average, a comfortable Dew Point temperature would be from 5 to 20 degrees.

It is possible to observe that users tend to prefer more humid days than dry days, this happens because warmer weathers tend to be more humid too, and our users already have a strong preference for warmer days. This can be showcased by the rentals outliers, mainly the ones above 2500, who are positioned around 5 to 20 degrees.

<h3>Humidity & Visibility vs. Rentals</h3>

Humidity and Visibility have a moderate relationship with rentals. Although their impact is moderate, they still add significant value to the analysis. Hence, this scatter plot compares rental counts with humidity (x-axis) and visibility (color).

Our Dew Point Temperature visualization indicated that users have preference for warmer and moderate humid days.

Days with lower visibility (darker blues hues) tend to exhibit higher humidity, as evidenced by the clustering of darker blues in the last two areas. In contrast, days with better visibility are, generally, less humid.

When focusing on the peak rental days (y-axis), we can see that users tend to utilize the services during days with high visibility, with a slight preference for days with low to moderate humidity.

*******************

<h2>Conclusion</h2><br>

The bike rental service faces impacts from different variables, varying from high to low relationships between them. The visuals and analysis allowed us to understand preferences and patterns in the customers behavior that can lead to better strategies to retain one-time users, fortify relationships with frequent users, and acquire new users.

Throughout the 7 visualizations, we were able to identify that customers are comfort-sensitive; they are motivated by favorable weather conditions that make riding bicycles a comfortable activity. Users are more likely to rent bikes during the summer season, when its warm and sunny, with better visibility and moderate humidity.

Data also illustrates that riders tend to utilize the vehicle during commute hours, implying that most users rent bikes to commute, which provides the company with the information necessary to generate promotions and allocate the amount of bikes necessary to attend demand.
